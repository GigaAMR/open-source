# PrestaShop Project's Office Hours

The Office Hours initiative is about project members making themselves available to the community (almost) every Tuesday at [11 am (Paris time)](https://time.is/1100_in_Paris), to discuss ongoing projects, pull requests, architectural decisions, etc. This is also a chance to answer questions from the community and help contributors finish their contributions.

## Join the next meeting!

Would you like to discuss a pull request you are working on? Or the future of the project? Do you just want to listen to the discussion? If so, joining the meeting will be a great idea.
