# Project dependency

The PrestaShop company and the PrestaShop project have always been intertwined.

In 2021, the PrestaShop company decided to [increase the differentiation][beyond-1.7] between the project and the company by removing all company-related products and services from the project.

This separation remains true today: the PrestaShop open source project does not contain commercials products (i.e products the company is making money from). This is the only separation as of today between the project and the company.
